#' DoubleClick for Publishers API from R
#'
#' The DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) API (recently renamed to Google Ad Manager) 
#' consists of roughly 50 services. Each service is written to handle a particular 
#' set of operations within the API and grouped.
#'
#' The official documentation, provided by Google, is available at:
#' \url{https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/rel_notes}
#' 
#' This package attempts to scrape the functionality and documentation from the 
#' references and WSDL to provide an interface via R. Each function has its own
#' documentation, but additional material can be found in the 
#' \href{https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/rdfp}{README} on GitHub
